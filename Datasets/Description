The 'Datasets' folder contains two domain corpora: Computer Science and Music Corpora. 
There are two kinds of corpus: clean and noisy corpus. The clean corpus consists only of the relevant terms that are related to the domain, 
while the noisy corpus provides all the extracted terms from the documents (relevant + irrelevant terms).
The whole information regarding these corpora are found in the ReadME.txt file of the corpus folder.
